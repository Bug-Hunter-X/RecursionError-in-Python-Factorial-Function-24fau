This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive Python functions: the RecursionError.  The `factorial.py` file contains a factorial function that correctly calculates factorials for non-negative integers.  However, calling it with a negative integer results in infinite recursion, leading to the RecursionError. The `factorial_solution.py` file provides a solution to handle negative input gracefully.
